    + App support for IFRAME embedding.
    + GUI support for browser back button, correct URL usage, links to GUI.
Roadmap 0.12
    + Changed GUI loading (gui initializes cubesviewer, breaks existing
      GUI HTML integrations!), in order to fix loading events ordering issue.
    + Loading to be less destructive reusing existing DOM elements (up to the plugin).
    + Support dimension attributes, and fact details in fact view etc..
    + Support better exploration of facts
    + Drop notes system 2: use metadata for info and add a comments system
    + Analytics plugin to ignore first N seconds of events as for bounce rate calculation.
    + jQGrid has changed licence (had to patch it). Change table component?!
Roadmap 0.11
    + Ability to filter from chart filter / synchronize filter and chart filter (?).
    + HTML, CSS and dynamic class usage sanitized (closes #14).
    + Data formatters (color, decimals, abbreviations, units, etc...). Allow client side changes?
    + Allow to show blank for zeros (can be changed client side for the view)
    + Implement limits to items shown in charts or dimension filters...?
    + GUI options (and all other plugin options) now as cubesviewer options
      (with plugin namespace?).
    + New set of *color* icons .
    + Bring back locale support!
    + View UI interface reworked (reminder: ajaxloader usage in many places...).
    + Horizontal dimension and measure dropdown from infobox (?) (see gui interface reworked)
    + Hide interface mode (also, make these programmable options for the views)
    + Fix too many series in legend issue (limit? alternate legend?).
    + Use bootstrap as JS template ??
    + Avoid leaving the page inadvertedely (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    + Jump to added view when creating a view (also make back/forward/url_links work?)
    + Dialogs (serialize, others...) are no longer javascript alerts.
    + GUI Interface, don't use menus (use divs, resizable when necessary). Also put messages here.
    + Make the entry point (gui.html, ...) more accessible (also review grunt branch)?
      Separate client from backend in dif folders at least? Client GUI with index.html, samples in separate folder.
      Package!
    + Make it clear when the results limit has been hit (for dimension values and aggregations).
    + Support negated cuts (also quick "invert" button in the cut-box).
    + Cut and remove option from horizontal dimension (?) (see gui interface reworked)
    + Show filter icon from "horizontal dimension". Also show its detail level (and perhaps not the hierarchy).
    + Scroll to recently open view on GUI (also provide function to do it from code for standalone views).
    + Short list cubes.js status for the list (fixes I had to do, not easy to add caching or get jQuery promise,
      not easy to get the path to be reused, missing facts I had to add, support for export/format,
      support for several servers desirable, inconsistent use of Cell/Browser interface or missing
      methods to transform drilldown_string<->drilldown object, same for cuts, documentation!!!!)
    + Dimensions were somehow promoted to be kind of a top-level UI objects to be selectable/draggable
    + Refactor libs to static/lib, join cubesviewer js and css in cubesviewer/js and cubesviewer/css  .
